        <h2>Hume's Problem</h2>
        <p>Hume's Is-Ought Problem is a philosophical concept that arises from the observation that it is often difficult to move from statements about how the world is to statements about how the world ought to be. He states his problem as: </p>
        <h4>"In every system of morality, which I have hitherto met with, I have always remarked, that the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary way of reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or makes observations concerning human affairs; when of a sudden I am surprised to find, that instead of the usual copulations of propositions, is, and is not, I meet with no proposition that is not connected with an ought, or an ought not. This change is imperceptible; but is, however, of the last consequence. For as this ought, or ought not, expresses some new relation or affirmation, it's necessary that it should be observed and explained; and at the same time that a reason should be given, for what seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others, which are entirely different from it. But as authors do not commonly use this precaution, I shall presume to recommend it to the readers; and am persuaded, that this small attention would subvert all the vulgar systems of morality, and let us see, that the distinction of vice and virtue is not founded merely on the relations of objects, nor is perceived by reason."</h4>
        <p>Hume is saying here that just because something is a certain way, it does not always follow that it is ought to be that way. We could state facts such as:</p>
        <h5 class="list">1. Murder is possibly painful.</h5>
        <h5 class="list">2. Murder can lead to jail time.</h5>
        <h5 class="list">3. Murder causes disruption in daily lives.</h5>
        <p>These are truthful facts, but just by collecting these it doesnt prove that murder is an evil act. On the other hand some may collect together facts and moral opinions such as:</p>
        <h5 class="list">1. Killing a living being is immoral.</h5>
        <h5 class="list">2. Fetus' in the womb are living beings.</h5>
        <h5 class="list">3. Therefore abortion is immoral.</h5>
        <p>Whether you agree with these statements or not you can see how Hume's argument proposes that fact and morality are two different ideas, that even though they can interact they are made up of different thoughts. Moving from facts to moral values requires additonal assumptions or introducing concepts such as "wellbeing", or "rights".</p>
        <h2>Facts</h2>
        <p>Facts by themselves are neutral in the moral sense, they describe what is the case in an objective view. Facts alone cannot tell us what to think in a moral perspective. In order to determine if murder is wrong based on fact we need to introduce the concept of wellbeing. Wellbeing is defined as:</p>
        <h4>"General health and happiness".</h4>
        <p>Based on this definition we have to assume that decreasing wellbeing is morally bad, and increasing and preserving wellbeing is morally good. Only after we include the concept of wellbeing we can conclude from the facts about murder whether it is morally bad or not. If we take a look at concluding whether stealing is bad or not based on facts. We could state facts such as:</p>
        <h5 class="list">1. Stealing takes away from others what they earned.</h5>
        <h5 class="list">2. Stealing disrupts daily lives.</h5>
        <h5 class="list">3. Stealing can lead to jail time.</h5>
        <p>These facts alone do not tell us whether stealing is morally wrong or not, we need to introduce the concept of rights in order to conclude whether stealing is bad or not. We have to assume that violating someones rights is morally wrong. Only then can we come to the conclusion that based off of those facts stealing is morally wrong. In both of these cases the facts only become relevant to the question of whether its morally right or not, once we include extra concepts such as "rights" or "wellbeing". Even with these concepts we still have to make assumptions on whether breaking your rights or wellbeing is morally wrong. These concepts go beyond merely describing what is the case as the facts do. They imbue the facts with moral meaning allowing us to bridge the gap between "is" and "ought".</p>
        <h2>Morals</h2>
        <p>Moral values are not always factual in nature, they are not just descriptions of what exists but involve judgements of value about how things should exist. We can only deduce factual moral values from a single source and that is the Bible. In order to move from facts to human moral opinions it requires additonal assumptions or concepts. This suggests that most moral values are not objective facts in the same way that some scientific facts are. However this does not mean that moral values are meaningless or arbitrary. We can still use reason and debate to justify our moral opinions. The challenge is finding a way to justify moral values in a way that is not relying on emotions or preference. One way we can do this is by taking a look at God's holy word, the Bible. In this text it states his Mosaic Commandments which are listed as:</p>
        <h5 class="listBible">1. I am the Lord thy God.</h5> 
        <h5 class="listBible">2. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image.</h5>
        <h5 class="listBible">3. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.</h5>
        <h5 class="listBible">4. Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.</h5>
        <h5 class="listBible">5. Honour thy father and thy mother.</h5>
        <h5 class="listBible">6. Thou shalt not kill.</h5>
        <h5 class="listBible">7. Thou shalt not commit adultery.</h5>
        <h5 class="listBible">8. Thou shalt not steal.</h5>
        <h5 class="listBible">9. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.</h5>
        <h5 class="listBible">10. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house or his slaves, or his animals, or anything of thy neighbour.</h5>
        <p>These Commandments declare whats right or wrong they tell us our base moral values, and all other values should be based off of these Commandments, and other parts of the Bible. Hume's argument raises questions about the source and justification of moral values. It does not in itself imply moral skepticism.</p>
        <h2>Concluding</h2>
        <p>In conclusion Hume's essay on the Is-Ought problem highlights the distinction between factual premises and moral judgements. It shows that some morals cant be derived from facts alones. But this does not necessary mean we cannot find ways to justify moral principles and values through a combination of facts, reason, and moral concepts. The challenge is determining what these justifications might be.</p>

        <h4>"The law of the LORD is perfect,</h4>
        <h4>refreshing the soul.</h4>
        <h4>The statutes of the LORD are trustworthy,</h4>
        <h4>making wise the simple.</h4>
        <h4>The precepts of the LORD are right,</h4>
        <h4>giving joy to the heart.</h4>
        <h4>The commands of the LORD are radiant,</h4>
        <h4>giving light to the eyes."</h4>
